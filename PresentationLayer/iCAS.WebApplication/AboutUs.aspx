    <li>The college crest</li>
        <li>Crest of the college is the integrated symbol of the aims and objectives of the
            institution, as conceived by the founders of the institutions during the eighties
            of the last century. </li>
            <li>At the bottom, on a curved base the place of establishment
            Bijaya Dhanurjaya Pur, followed by the name of the District Ganjam is epigraphed.
            In between two equidistant circles, below and in between the two illuminating stars,
            the year of establishment is inscribed 1981. It is traced back to 10th July 1981
            the date on which the college started to sail on into the academic ocean with its
            crew. The stars illuminating indicate the light agglowing out with the spread of
            higher education in and around the college circumference. It also guides to the
            frontiers of the college from with in the campus and out to all who is acquisitive
            of knowledge and excellence in human creativity. </li>
            <li>On the back-drop of a landscape
            at top stands a range of mountains to the North – West of the college site. At the
            top Tentulia Sasan Debasthan College is inscribed. The nomenclature is a confluence
            of three inherently and perpetuating patronizing forces. The people of the adjacent
            village Tentualia sacrificed generously their old school building that became the
            birth place and cradle of the first born babe (College) in the entire geographic
            landscape between Bhanjanagar at the far west, Odogam at the north-east and Buguda
            out slated to the south-east. The geographic entity is skirted out by River Boda
            and Badanadi, in between stands two range of mountains painted in light blue. Across
            the area a large number of old religious monuments stands over centuries with religious
            forbearance of the local populace, thus the patrons chose to insert the term Debasthan.
            It is preceded by Sasan, a village that cradled the college nursed it to its present
            stature. The patrons of education and learning pioneered to integrate the calumniating
            forces for establishment and nourishment of the college against all vicissitudes
            of time and deficits in infrastructure. </li>
            <li>At the centre a book is placed wide open
            ahead of a sparkling light. It is the prime motto to wipe out the stains of ignorance,
            thus the spread of light and knowledge would follow. All about is enshrined in the
            Bye-law of the college under the Registration of Societies Act of 1860. </li>
