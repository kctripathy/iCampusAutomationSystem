            The local people realized the deficit of an institution for higher study for which the vulnerable section
            of the local community is deprived of higher education. Specifically the girl child
            and SC/ST/OBC students unable to afford the cost of higher education and join the
            swelling army of the dropouts. But they can pursue a higher and qualitative goal
            at a lower social and economic cost at their door steps if the deficit is made up
            with a college.

        </p>
        <p>
            The college got registered under the U.G.C. Act 1956 vide clauses 2(f) and 12(b)
            with effect from 24.10 2008, a turning point for progress of the institution.  Please
