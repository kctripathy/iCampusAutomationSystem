            On the back-drop of a landscape at top stands a range of mountains to the North – West of the college site. At the top Tentulia Sasan Debasthan College is inscribed. The nomenclature is a confluence of three inherently and perpetuating patronizing forces. The people of the adjacent village Tentualia sacrificed generously their old school building that became the birth place and cradle of the first born babe (College) in the entire geographic landscape between Bhanjanagar at the far west, Odogam at the north-east and Buguda out slated to the south-east. The geographic entity is skirted out by River Boda and Badanadi, in between stands two range of mountains painted in light blue. Across the area a large number of old religious monuments stands over centuries with religious forbearance of the local populace, thus the patrons chose to insert the term Debasthan. It is preceded by Sasan, a village that cradled the college nursed it to its present stature. The patrons of education and learning pioneered to integrate the calumniating forces for establishment and nourishment of the college against all vicissitudes of time and deficits in infrastructure.
